Question-1
Find a pair with the given sum in an array
Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with the given sum in it.
For example
Input: nums = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]target = 10 Output: Pair found (8, 2)orPair found (7, 3) 
Question-2
Given an integer array, replace each element with the product of every other element without using the division operator.
For example,
Input:  { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }Output: { 120, 60, 40, 30, 24 }  Input:  { 5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 8 }Output: { 1152, 1920, 1440, 2880, 960, 720 }
Question-3
Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
Given a circular integer array, find a subarray with the largest sum in it.
For example :Input:  {2, 1, -5, 4, -3, 1, -3, 4, -1} Output: Subarray with the largest sum is {4, -1, 2, 1} with sum 6.


Question-4:
Find the maximum difference between two array elements that satisfies the given constraints
Given an integer array, find the maximum difference between two elements in it such that the smaller element appears before the larger element.
For example:Input:  { 2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5 } Output: The maximum difference is 7. The pair is (2, 9) 

Question:5 
Given an array of integers of size N, the task is to find the first non-repeating element in this array. 
Examples:
Input: {-1, 2, -1, 3, 0}
Output: 2
Explanation: The first number that does not repeat is : 2
Input: {9, 4, 9, 6, 7, 4}
Output: 6

Question:6
Minimize the maximum difference between the heights
Given the heights of N towers and a value of K, Either increase or decrease the height of every tower by K (only once) where K > 0. After modifications, the task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower and output its difference.
Examples: 
Input: arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
Output:  Maximum difference is 5.
Explanation: Change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5 (between 4 and 9). We canâ€™t get a lower difference.
Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 15, 10}, k = 3   
Output: Maximum difference is 8, arr[] = {4, 8, 12, 7}
